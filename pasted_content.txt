Project Title: Development of Gun Drill Machine Standard Time Calculator via Power Apps

1. Project Overview:
This project involves the creation of a Power Apps-based calculator designed to estimate the standard time required for gun drilling operations. The tool integrates time study results, actual cutting parameters, and machining features, providing a unified and standardized method for time estimation. The aim is to improve routing consistency across manufacturing operations and enable more accurate product costing.

2. Objectives:

Develop an intuitive and efficient Power Apps calculator.

Integrate cutting parameters, tool geometry, and feature-based calculations.

Eliminate discrepancies between routing creators.

Provide a centralized, user-friendly tool accessible to manufacturing personnel.

3. Scope:

Input: Drill size, RPM, feed rate, material grade, length to drill, tool wear considerations, setup time, grinding time, wall thickness inspection.

Output: Standard drilling time per feature or per part.

Users: Routing engineers, manufacturing planners, process engineers.

Deployment: Internal Power Apps platform with access control.

4. Functional Requirements:

UI for entering drill parameters and job-specific data.

Backend logic that interprets and applies formulas from time study tables.

Option to compute total time for multiple features per job.

Ability to export calculated values to Excel.

Historical log of calculated jobs (via Power Automate/SharePoint).

Error handling and input validation.

5. Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: Must return results within 2 seconds of submission.

Usability: Simple UI design, minimal training required.

Maintainability: Logic must be documented and modular.

Security: Restricted to internal users; editable access for admins only.

6. System Architecture:

Front End: Microsoft Power Apps (Canvas)

Parameter entry fields

Output display card

Dynamic visuals (e.g., gauge or progress bar for drill time)

Data Source: Excel spreadsheet (initial) or migrated SharePoint List

Stores time study data mapped by material, size, and feed

Can be updated without republishing the app

Business Logic Layer:

Conditional rules apply grinding time, setup time, inspection time

RPM and feed rate influence cut time

Total time = (Cutting Time) + (Setup Time) + (Grinding Time) + (Inspection Time)

Automation:

Power Automate flow to save results to SharePoint list

Optional PDF or email export for results summary

7. UI/UX Design:

Main Screen Layout:

Section 1: Job/Part details (dropdown)

Section 2: Drill parameters (input fields)

Section 3: Advanced settings (e.g., grinding cycle frequency)

Section 4: Results panel

Section 5: Export/save controls

Accessibility Features:

Tooltips for each input field

Highlight invalid/missing values

Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

9. Risks & Mitigation:

Risk: Excel table misalignment or changes

Mitigation: Define strict format; use SharePoint for structure

Risk: Incorrect parameter inputs

Mitigation: Use dropdowns, limits, and warnings

Risk: Power Apps limitations on performance

Mitigation: Optimize logic, minimize screen refresh, use delegation

User Guide — with step-by-step instructions and screenshots

Admin Guide — managing data tables, updating logic

System Documentation — architecture diagram, logic flow, dependencies

Test Report — log of tested input scenarios and output verification

Change Log Template — for maintaining future updates

11. Future Enhancements:

API Integration with ERP for job routing auto-fill

Role-based access control and approval workflows

AI-assisted feed & speed recommendations based on past data

Visual drill path simulation or animation
